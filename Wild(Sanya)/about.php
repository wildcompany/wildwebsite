                <p>
                   From Frustration to a Labor of Love and a Real Business Honestly, this whole skincare journey started because I just couldn’t find anything that worked for my own skin. I tried all these well-known brands, spent money on things that promised a lot, but my skin was still unhappy—dry, breaking out. One day at a farmer’s market, I stumbled on some natural skincare and it got me thinking: why not make my own? I grew up with a family that believed in herbal remedies, and I had a passion for pure ingredients. So I started experimenting in my own kitchen and created something that finally made my skin happy.
                  But it didn’t stop there. As friends started asking me to make some for them, I realized I wanted to turn this into a real business. I started reading books about business, enrolled at HEC Montréal, and step by step, I registered my brand. Our first event was called Herbal Kitchen, and that’s when I really saw it come to life. So this is more than just a product—it’s a journey of learning, growing, and bringing a personal touch of nature to you.

          Our daily mission is to embrace the joy of discovering the science and gifts of nature, transforming them into high-quality skincare that connects deeply to our well-being. We’re driven by the delight of ethically crafting each product—from the careful harvesting of botanicals to the thoughtful conservation of our resources—so that the entire process is as enjoyable and respectful as the final experience. Ultimately, we create with a purpose: to ensure our products bring joy and well-being not only to those who use them, but also to the environment we’re part of.

          <li>Educate and empower conscious consumers;</li>
