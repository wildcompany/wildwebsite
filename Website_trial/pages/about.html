        <h4>My Journey</h4>
        <p>Welcome! I’m <b>Sara Hashemi Nasab</b> — an entrepreneurial spirit, lifelong learner, and lover of meaningful connections. I’m passionate about blending knowledge, creativity, and nature to create experiences that inspire growth and authenticity.</p>

        <p>My journey bridges many worlds — from <b>entrepreneurship and emotional intelligence to art, design, and wellness</b>. I’m endlessly curious about how science and self-awareness can help us live with more clarity, compassion, and creativity.</p>

        <p>Beyond business and research, I find joy in <b>nature walks, dance, and art</b> — spaces where I can reflect, recharge, and express myself freely. Whether designing clothes, painting, or simply sharing ideas, I see creativity as a way to connect deeply with others and the world around us. Learn more about

        <p>This website is more than my personal corner of the web — it’s a celebration of collaboration, exploration, and growth. I’m honored to share it with the wonderful people who make every project meaningful.</p>
