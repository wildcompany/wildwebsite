    <h3 style="font-size:1.4rem; font-weight:700; color:#222;">How Personal Growth Became a Mission to Help Others</h3>
    <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
      This journey grew out of my own real-life experience. While I was working on my skincare business
      <span style="font-weight:700; text-decoration:underline; color:#004aad;">project</span>,
      I ended up diving into emotional intelligence and leadership studies.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
      It began with a simple motivation: I realized that knowing accounting, business registration, the science of skincare, and laws and regulations wasn’t enough if I couldn’t handle the human part of leadership. The emotional and cultural challenges, the misunderstandings, and the daily human interactions in my team were just as important as the technical work. Specifically, I wanted to improve how I related to one of my business team members who was also my friend at that time.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
      Consequently, during my supervised project in my Master’s program in International Business, I spent over 2,000 hours researching this subject. The result was a big change in me. I became calmer and more in control of my emotions, and people around me even commented on it. They told me I seemed much more at peace. At the same time, the friendship and work relationship with my friend and business team member improved significantly.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
      Later, I wrote a full pedagogical case study about this transformation in my program. This made me clearly see that it wasn’t just theory — it was a real, practical transformation that I had lived personally and inside my company.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
      Because of that experience, I decided to share these results and coach other leaders to lead with emotional intelligence, calm, and balance — and to bring a healthier emotional culture into their work and life.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
        We envision a community where emotional intelligence is understood as a practical, everyday skill — a kind of wisdom that helps people lead their emotions instead of being led by them. A community where leaders make decisions with calm, clarity, and understanding, and where this creates healthier interactions in workplaces, friendships, and the broader society.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.15rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444;">
        Our mission is to help leaders understand their emotions deeply, take ownership of them, and guide them wisely. Through practical learning and real-life application, we support leaders in becoming calmer, clearer, and more emotionally aware — so their decisions and interactions create thoughtful and balanced environments around them.
