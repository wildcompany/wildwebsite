🌿 Wild-InternshipWebsite

This project is a personal business website developed as part of an internship. It is designed to promote and sell skincare products, support emotional intelligence awareness, and organize visits to herbal farms where users can explore natural wellness practices.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP with a database for the backend. All components are seamlessly integrated to create a fully functional platform that manages products, user interactions, and business information in one unified system.
